# fantasy-caching

### What is fantasy-caching?

Fantasy-chaching is an adventure game using geolocation and Google Maps APIs.
It is inspired by geocaching, Pokemon GO, and roguelike video games.
It will allow players to go on a virtual/physical adventure around Lexington, KY.


### Plans for fantasy-caching?

Users can:

* Log in
* Create Character
* Save Session
* Discover Treasure around the city
* Collect Treasure around the city
* Leave items, notes around the city for other users to discover
* Discover Monsters
* Enter into Combat with Monsters
* Interact with NPCs
* Buy and Sell treasure from NPCs


### Why am I developing fantasy-caching?

I am developing this game for two reasons, to have fun and practice web development.

#### 1. Have Fun

I love gaming, programming, walking, and creativity. Developing fantasy-caching is a great blend of all these things.
My hope is to develop a game that allows others the experience of adventure where they live.

#### 2. Practice Web Dev

I recently completed a software development bootcamp training in Lexington, KY (Awesome Inc). There I learned the development process from the ground up and am now a full-stack developer. This was a full-time program (50 hrs/wk) and lasted 12 weeks. In that time we learned all we need to take a project from back to front. I enjoyed every minute of that experience and am eager to continue my learning through personal projects.

Here is a list of tools I hope to use while developing Fantasy-caching

__Front End__

* Javascript
* AngularJS
* Google Materialize

__Back End__

* PHP
* Laravel

I would like to fantasy-caching to be mobile freindly and scalable.
Although I like the idea of single-session games, I want to deploy a database that will keep track of user information (username, password, high scores, adventure notes).

### How can you help?

Let me know what you think! I am open to questions, ideas and advice.
